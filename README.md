# canvas-tui

A simple terminal user interface wrapper around the Canvas LMS

### Setup

Create a '.env' file in the root directory of the project and populate with:
```
CANVAS_API_TOKEN = "your_api_key"
```

This project will respect Canvas' course nicknames and it is HIGHLY recommended
to nickname your courses in canvas to something short (ex: "CALCULUS FOR
SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS III" -> "MATH 213"). This can be done by going to the
canvas dashboard in "Card View" and modifying the course nickname in the card
properties.

Currently data storage is only supported on *nix systems (stored in ~/.local/share/canvas-tui/).

NOTE: course-ids are defined in ~/.local/share/canvas-tui/data.json

### Keybidings

```
j -> move selection down
k -> move selection up
d -> toggle competion status of selected assignment
o -> open assignment url in browser
q -> quit
r -> force refresh
n -> enter new assignment mode
    a-z -> fill out text field
    tab -> go to next field
    esc/C-c > exit new assignment mode
    j/k -> when due date selected decrement/increment date
x -> delete custom assignment
```

### Background

This project originated as a BlasterHacks 2025 project [canvas.lte](https://github.com/hoehlrich/canvas-tui)
programmed in conjunction with [shauryasaxenas](https://github.com/shauryasaxenas). This fork is an attempt to
remedy the various issues with the original project in a smaller scope: just
the Canvas API and TUI (removed web frontend and groq integration). Ideally,
this project's backend connects back to the original project to provide a more
functional web frontend.

### TODO
- [X] Fix TUI async refresh
- [X] Fix data file path
- [X] Remove server feature

- [X] Make items that have been submitted (as defined by the API) gray (instead of disappearing)
- [X] Auto-refresh on startup
- [X] Make async refresh only update changed data (to preserve completion status)
- [X] Make # of upcoming assignments respect completed assignments
- [X] Prevent scroll up down wraparound
- [X] Fix issue: can only refresh when run using 'cargo r'
- [X] Refactor to not use graphql_client (didn't do because serialization would be a pain in the ass)

- [ ] Rework assignment query to use REST instead of graphql
- [ ] Canvas assignment link scraping
- [ ] Reinstate links pane
- [ ] Download pdf files and open in zathura (maybe)
- [ ] Add timer column and let it be resetable and pausable (maybe)
