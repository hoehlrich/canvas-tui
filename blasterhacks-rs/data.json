Start by prioritizing assignments with earlier deadlines, focusing on the multiple integrals homework, LGA 24, WebAssign Homework #9, and Worksheet 10 due on Monday. Allocate specific times for each task, ensuring completion before the deadlines. On Tuesday and Wednesday, focus on WebWork Homework and Studio Points. Use Thursday to review and prepare for Exam 2. After the exam, dedicate time to completing outstanding homework and worksheets, and begin preparing for the next set of exams and quizzes. Make sure to set aside dedicated blocks for reviewing and practicing material, especially for the vector fields and divergence and curl homework due on Sunday. By creating a schedule and sticking to it, you'll be able to manage your workload effectively and stay on top of your assignments."}
