The assignment is not a traditional written assignment, but rather an opportunity for students to test their knowledge, apply concepts, and develop problem-solving skills in a specific subject area. By working through these practice problems, students can identify areas where they need improvement, solidify their grasp of key concepts, and prepare themselves for upcoming assessments or exams, ultimately helping them to stay on track with the course material and achieve their learning objectives.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71415/assignments/457754","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Reading Week 12","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p><span><strong>Chapter 9 &nbsp;(Pg. 480-537)</strong><br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.1 &nbsp;Introduction<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.2 &nbsp;Payback Period Analysis<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.3 &nbsp;Savings Are Analogous to Income&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.4 &nbsp;Sunk Costs and Opportunity Costs&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.5 &nbsp;Breakeven Analyses<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.6 &nbsp;Three Methods of Investment Valuation&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.7 &nbsp;NPV Use for Breakeven Acquisition Cost Valuation&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.7a NPV Use for Breakeven Sale Value Analysis&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.8 &nbsp;Valuation of Public Projects and Investments&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.9 &nbsp;Cash Flow Versus Shareholder Reporting&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">and Net Income<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.10 &nbsp;Net Income Criteria Compared to Cash Flow Criteria<br></span><span style=\"font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">9.10a Value Added</span></p>\n<p><strong>Chapter 10 (Pg. 551-575)</strong></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 9\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span>10.1 General Replacement Philosophy <br>10.2 Leasing Compared to Purchasing <br>10.3 Sunk Costs and Opportunity Costs Related to Replacement&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108467/dp_app%20%25281%2529.js\"></script>","html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71415/assignments/457770","date":"2025-04-04T23:59:00-06:00","course":"ENGINEERING ECONOMICS","summary":"The university assignment covers chapters 9 and 10 of a textbook, focusing on financial analysis and investment valuation.

However, I can make an educated guess that HW#9 is likely a problem-set or project-based assignment that aims to assess students' understanding of key concepts and theories covered in the course up to that point. The assignment may involve solving problems, conducting research, analyzing data, or completing a case study, depending on the discipline and instructor's goals. Students are usually expected to apply critical thinking, analytical skills, and knowledge acquired throughout the course to complete the assignment, which may also include writing a report, creating a presentation, or submitting a set of solutions to problems. Overall, HW#9 is an opportunity for students to demonstrate their learning, practice applying course concepts, and receive feedback to improve their understanding before the final assessment.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71415/assignments/457746","title":"Canvas"},{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71415/files/7334038?verifier=1SDy9x8P63BQYzoAhj49BZ9v9MKFqVV2DBg5GALi&wrap=1","title":"A7-2 (17th Edition Variation) .pdf"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Homework 11","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p>Assignment: <a id=\"7758879\" class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72131/files/7758879?verifier=WpzrDTQcr9CrbxcTSPTLVMA14YIeNmZGZoEwYIIj&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-canvas-previewable=\"true\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/72131/files/7758879\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">SP25_M334_HW11.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Template (optional): <a id=\"7758878\" class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72131/files/7758878?verifier=sFQBDqv035pn3JMzakwEmgWkOpxJ1Y4lN9cZVDMp&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/72131/files/7758878\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">SP25_M334_HW11_template.zip</a></p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108467/dp_app%20%25281%2529.js\"></script>","html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72131/assignments/482255","date":"2025-04-04T23:59:59-06:00","course":"INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY","summary":"The provided HTML describes a university assignment with a downloadable PDF file named \"SP25_M334_HW11.pdf\" and an optional template file named \"SP25_M334_HW11_template.zip\".

You may also wish to include a destructor (see the section below titled Destruction).</p>\n<p>Because node objects should only be used by the <code>trie</code> class itself, there is no reason to make the node class publicly available.&nbsp; While you may declare this class or struct as a separate type outside of <code>trie</code>, consider instead making it a nested class within the private section of your <code>trie</code> class.&nbsp; A nested class structure looks like this:</p>\n<pre>class A {<br>private:<br>    class B {<br>        int x;<br>    };<br>};</pre>\n<p>This declares a class, <code>B</code>, which is only available for use within the <code>A</code> class and its methods.&nbsp; Note that visibility still applies here; the variable <code>x</code> inside objects of type <code>B</code> may not be accessed by methods of class <code>A</code> unless they are declared public within <code>B</code>.</p>\n<h4>Trie class</h4>\n<p>To support the public methods described above, the <code>trie</code> class will need some internal state.&nbsp; However, for our simple implementation we do not need much - a node to represent the root of the trie should be sufficient.&nbsp; The root node may be statically or dynamically allocated depending on your preference.&nbsp; You may optionally include a constructor to set up the root node (see the section below titled Initialization). &nbsp;You may also wish to include a destructor (see the section below titled Destruction).</p>\n<h4>Initialization</h4>\n<p>Each node in your trie must be initialized properly when created.&nbsp; E.g., all of the child pointers should start as <code>nullptr</code>.&nbsp; You may wish to do this initialization as part of a node class constructor, or you can instead set up nodes as they are created by the <code>trie</code> class.&nbsp; You also need to set the node class to indicate whether or not it represents a terminal node.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to initialize the root node when the <code>trie</code> object itself is created!</p>\n<h4>Destruction (optional)</h4>\n<p>To avoid memory leaks, all dynamically allocated node objects should be deallocated when no longer needed (i.e., when the trie is destroyed).&nbsp; Note that we have no way of testing this!&nbsp; Therefore, doing deallocation is optional.&nbsp; We recommend it for the practice, but get the tests running first.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to do this is to include a destructor in your node class; the destructor simply needs to deallocate any children it holds.&nbsp; If your root node is dynamically allocated, then it must be deallocated in a destructor method in the <code>trie</code> class.&nbsp; When the root node is destroyed, its destructor will be invoked; if the destructor deallocates its children (invoking their destructors in turn), then the entire tree of nodes will get recursively deallocated without much effort on your part.</p>\n<p>If you prefer, you may instead deallocate the entire tree of node objects as part of the <code>trie</code> destructor using a post-order traversal of the tree.&nbsp; Why might you prefer to do this?&nbsp; In general, it is good practice to tie object creation and destruction closely together.&nbsp; If the <code>trie</code> class allocates node objects, it might be best for it to have responsibility for destroying them when no longer needed.&nbsp; However, since the trie node class is tightly bound to the <code>trie</code> class anyway, it is not \"wrong\" to do deallocation in the node class destructor if preferred.</p>\n<h4>Insertion</h4>\n<p>The <code>insert()</code> method may be written recursively or iteratively as you prefer.&nbsp; If you do it recursively, you will probably need a helper method.&nbsp; Either way, the process is straightforward; work your way down the tree of nodes, one character of the input string at a time.&nbsp; As long as the character is already stored, you don't need to do anything; however, if you encounter a <code>nullptr</code> on your path, you need to replace the <code>nullptr</code> with a newly allocated node object.&nbsp; Make sure you mark the last node in the path as a terminal value!</p>\n<h4>Containment and prefix testing</h4>\n<p>Containment and prefix testing a very similar, and may closely mirror the form of your <code>insert()</code> method.&nbsp; Work your way down the tree of nodes, one character of the input string at a time; if you cannot make a transition (i.e., you encounter a <code>nullptr</code>), then return <code>false</code>.&nbsp; For containment, return true only if the last node you encounter is a terminal node; for prefix testing, return true if you reach end of the input string, regardless of whether it is terminal or not.</p>\n<h4>Prefix extension</h4>\n<p>The <code>extends()</code> method takes in a prefix string and a reference to a <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code>.&nbsp; There are (of course) multiple ways to approach writing this method, but there are essentially two phases of work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Work your way down the tree one character of the prefix string at a time.&nbsp; (If you encounter a <code>nullptr</code>, then just return without doing anything else - this prefix doesn't exist in the trie.)&nbsp; This will put you at the top of the sub-tree representing all of the words for which the prefix string is a prefix.</li>\n<li>Next, do a pre-order traversal of the sub-tree rooted by the prefix string - you will need a recursive helper method for this.&nbsp; As you traverse the tree, you need to keep track of what string is represented at each node.&nbsp; When you encounter a terminal node, append the string represented by that node to the vector.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Running and testing</h2>\n<p>In order to build your solution, you may use the cmake and make commands as usual.</p>\n<p>After you create a build directory with:</p>\n<pre>cmake . -B build</pre>\n<p>or, on a MinGW setup</p>\n<pre>cmake . -B build -G \"MinGW Makefiles\"</pre>\n<p>you may compile and run the test suite:</p>\n<pre>cd build<br>make<br>./run-tests</pre>\n<p>(There is no need to specify a make target - the default target will build everything.)&nbsp; You can also write your own testing code in <code>main.cpp</code>, and then run that code:</p>\n<pre>make<br>./run-main</pre>\n<p>For debugging, use</p>\n<pre>gdb run-main</pre>\n<p><span>For more on GDB, see&nbsp;</span><a title=\"Getting Help and Other Resources\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/pages/getting-help-and-other-resources?wrap=1\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/72567/pages/getting-help-and-other-resources\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Getting Help and Other Resources.</a></p>\n<h2>Rubric</h2>\n<p><strong>S&nbsp;</strong>- All tests pass, and the total time to run all tests on the test server is &lt;

Not surprisingly, commercial online dictionaries (even if free to use online) do not give their word lists out freely.&nbsp; There are, however, many open source spelling dictionaries and the like; for example, the <code>aspell</code> spell checker (freely available on linux) comes with a spelling dictionary.&nbsp; That particular dictionary is not well suited for this project, as it includes punctuation; it is also somewhat smaller than the file provided for this project. (However, there are <code>aspell</code> dictionaries for other languages, so if you'd like to make a trie for e.g., Portuguese, appropriate word lists are available.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The provided file is a well-known and widely shared public domain data set generally known as the \"ENABLE\" (<span>Enhanced North American Benchmark LEexicon</span>) word list, and was designed primarily for use with various word games.&nbsp; (Most word games don't allow words of one letter, which is why the word \"a\" doesn't appear in the file.)&nbsp; For more information about this data set, see this <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"http://wiki.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=solving:wordlists:about:enable_readme&amp;s=enable\" target=\"_blank\">ENABLE word list README file</a>.</p>\n<h2>Submit to Gradescope</h2>\n<p>When all your tests are running \"green\", then you are done and can submit your code for grading. To do so, load the assignment in Gradescope by clicking the button below and submit <strong>at least</strong> your <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>, <code>trie.h</code>, and <code>trie.cpp</code>&nbsp;files. You may include other files if they are required for your solution to build (you do not need to include anything in the test directories).&nbsp; Gradescope lets you either upload a ZIP file or drag and drop individual files; do whatever works for you.

The trie should be able to insert strings, check if a string is present, and generate a list of words that start with a given prefix. The project provides a basic structure, including a `trie.h` and `trie.cpp` file, and requires students to implement the necessary methods, including `insert`, `contains`, `is_prefix`, and `extend`. The assignment also involves managing dynamically allocated memory and linked structures, and students are expected to follow a specific workflow and submit their code to Gradescope for grading. The project is evaluated based on the tests passing and the total time to run all tests, with the highest score possible being \"S\" if all tests pass and the total time is less than 1 second.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/assignments/469668","title":"Canvas"},{"url":" https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/pages/help-sessions-and-office-hours","title":"Help Sessions and Office Hours"},{"url":" https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/pages/programming-projects-workflow?wrap=1","title":"Programming Projects Workflow"},{"url":" https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/pages/getting-help-and-other-resources?wrap=1","title":"Getting Help and Other Resources"},{"url":" http://wiki.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=solving:wordlists:about:enable_readme&s=enable","title":"ENABLE word list README file"},{"url":" https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/pages/programming-projects-workflow","title":"Programming Projects Workflow"}],"has_description":true}],"grades":[{"course":"COMPUTER ORGANIZATION","grade":81.67,"course_id":71983},{"course":"DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS","grade":100.0,"course_id":72567},{"course":"ENGINEERING ECONOMICS","grade":89.58,"course_id":71415},{"course":"INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY","grade":93.42,"course_id":72131}],"plan":"To tackle the upcoming assignments, create a study plan that prioritizes tasks based on their due dates.
