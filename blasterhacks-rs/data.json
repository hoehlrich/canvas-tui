The assignment likely requires students to apply the change of variables formula to evaluate double or triple integrals, which involves transforming the region of integration and the integrand to a more convenient coordinate system. This technique is useful for simplifying complex integrals and making them more manageable. Students will need to identify the appropriate change of variables, compute the Jacobian determinant, and apply the change of variables formula to evaluate the given integrals, demonstrating their understanding of this important concept in multivariable calculus.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453253","title":"Canvas"}]},{"name":"LGA 24 - Heaps and priority queues","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p>See the PDF below for instructions for this LGA.</p>\n<p><a class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" title=\"lga-24-heap.pdf\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/files/7755291?verifier=SGhnrtz1GoXVmSy5dBCojEoFcjcGlgKM4N4aNEph&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-canvas-previewable=\"false\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/72567/files/7755291\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">lga-24-heap.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Answer key:</strong> coming soon!</p>\n<p><strong>Readings (<a class=\"inline_disabled external\" href=\"https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/mines/detail.action?docID=3339142\" target=\"_blank\"><span>CLRS</span><span class=\"external_link_icon\" role=\"presentation\"><span class=\"screenreader-only\">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chapter 6, \"Heapsort\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lecture videos</strong>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"inline_disabled external\" href=\"https://youtu.be/tooZ0YfuOao\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"external_link_icon\" role=\"presentation\"><span class=\"screenreader-only\">inks to an external site.</span></span></a></p>\n<table style=\"width: 83.4981%;

This may involve tasks such as finding the divergence and curl of a vector field, identifying properties of vector fields like conservative or solenoidal fields, and using vector fields to model and analyze physical systems, ultimately helping students develop a deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts and their practical applications.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453269","title":"Canvas"}]},{"name":"17.5 HW - Divergence and Curl","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p style=\"display: none;\">[syncid:XL:urn:udson:pearson.com/xl/highered:homeworkhistory/98297-H-568644755-2]</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108467/dp_app%20%25281%2529.js\"></script>","html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453367","date":"2025-04-06T23:59:00-06:00","course":"MATH 213","summary":"The assignment \"17.5 HW - Divergence and Curl\" is a homework assignment focused on the mathematical concepts of divergence and curl in vector calculus. Divergence measures how much a vector field diverges or \"spreads out\" from a given point, while curl measures the rotation or \"curl\" of the vector field around a point. The assignment likely requires students to apply these concepts to solve problems involving vector fields, such as calculating the divergence and curl of given vector fields, identifying the physical interpretations of these quantities, and using them to analyze and visualize the behavior of vector fields in various contexts, such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, or other areas of physics and engineering. By completing this assignment, students will demonstrate their understanding of these fundamental concepts and their ability to apply them to solve problems in mathematics and physics.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453367","title":"Canvas"}]},{"name":"Worksheet 11","description":null,"html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453564","date":"2025-04-07T23:59:59-06:00","course":"MATH 213","summary":null,"relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453564","title":"Canvas"}]},{"name":"Exam #2","description":null,"html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453457","date":"2025-04-07T23:59:59-06:00","course":"MATH 213","summary":null,"relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453457","title":"Canvas"}]},{"name":"Topic 4A WebWork Homework","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p>Complete the Topic 4A WebWork Homework on WebWork (linked below).
