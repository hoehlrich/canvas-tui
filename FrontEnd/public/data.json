This technique is used to simplify complex integrals by transforming them into a more manageable form using a different set of variables. The assignment likely requires students to apply the change of variables formula to multiple integrals, which involves calculating the Jacobian determinant and using it to transform the integral. Students will need to demonstrate their understanding of the concept by working through a series of problems, using the change of variables technique to evaluate given multiple integrals, and providing the final answers in the required format. By completing this assignment, students will reinforce their understanding of the mathematical principles underlying the change of variables technique and develop their problem-solving skills in the context of multiple integrals.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453253","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"LGA 24 - Heaps and priority queues","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p>See the PDF below for instructions for this LGA.</p>\n<p><a class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" title=\"lga-24-heap.pdf\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72567/files/7755291?verifier=SGhnrtz1GoXVmSy5dBCojEoFcjcGlgKM4N4aNEph&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-canvas-previewable=\"false\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/72567/files/7755291\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">lga-24-heap.pdf</a></p>\n<p><strong>Answer key:</strong> coming soon!</p>\n<p><strong>Readings (<a class=\"inline_disabled external\" href=\"https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/mines/detail.action?docID=3339142\" target=\"_blank\"><span>CLRS</span><span class=\"external_link_icon\" role=\"presentation\"><span class=\"screenreader-only\">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chapter 6, \"Heapsort\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Lecture videos</strong>:</p>\n<p><a class=\"inline_disabled external\" href=\"https://youtu.be/tooZ0YfuOao\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"external_link_icon\" role=\"presentation\"><span class=\"screenreader-only\">inks to an external site.</span></span></a></p>\n<table style=\"width: 83.4981%;

The unit step function, also known as the Heaviside step function, is a discontinuous function that switches from 0 to 1 at a certain point, and it is often used to model sudden changes or switches in physical systems. The assignment will likely involve finding the Laplace transforms of various functions, including the unit step function, and using these transforms to solve differential equations that model real-world systems, such as electrical circuits or mechanical systems. By working through the problems on the worksheet, students will gain practice in applying Laplace transforms to solve differential equations and in analyzing the behavior of systems that involve sudden changes or switches, which is an important skill in fields such as engineering and physics.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71447/assignments/462949","title":"Canvas"},{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71447/files/7745266?verifier=1Oh3Tj8eLFx7YOOhuFrK7VdNfgYgImfN25Nt1hF7&wrap=1","title":"MATH225S25-WS9.pdf"},{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71447/files/7745255?wrap=1","title":"AK-MATH225S25-WS9.pdf"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Exam 2","description":null,"html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71447/assignments/462923","date":"2025-04-03T23:59:59-06:00","course":"MATH 225","summary":null,"relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71447/assignments/462923","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Topic 4B Studio Points","description":null,"html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72767/assignments/454219","date":"2025-04-04T19:00:00-06:00","course":"PHGN 200","summary":null,"relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72767/assignments/454219","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Participation Quiz 15","description":null,"html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/482220","date":"2025-04-04T23:59:00-06:00","course":"MATH 213","summary":null,"relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/482220","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"HW10","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p>This is an individual assignment - do not show your work or any solutions to your peers in any section of CSCI 341, only discuss concepts and ideas, per the<span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"instructure_file_holder link_holder instructure_file_link_holder\"><a class=\"inline_disabled preview_in_overlay\" title=\"CS@MinesCollaborationPolicy.pdf\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71983/files/7379623?verifier=xqahxTu8ElKNMcxr7qNJXODmLTd3S3ULadsKnxz0&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/71983/files/7379623\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">CS@Mines Collaboration Policy</a><a class=\"file_download_btn\" role=\"button\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/71983/files/7379623/download?verifier=xqahxTu8ElKNMcxr7qNJXODmLTd3S3ULadsKnxz0\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/71983/files/7379623\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><span role=\"presentation\"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"screenreader-only\">Download CS@Mines Collaboration Policy</span></a><span class=\"screenreader-only\">Download CS@Mines Collaboration Policy</span><a class=\"file_download_btn\" role=\"button\" href=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/36681/files/3839204/download?download_frd=1\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://elearning.mines.edu/api/v1/courses/36681/files/3839204\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><span class=\"screenreader-only\">Download CS@Mines Collaboration Policy</span></a></span>.

The divergence and curl are two fundamental concepts in vector calculus that describe the behavior of vector fields. Divergence measures the rate at which a vector field diverges or converges at a given point, indicating whether the field is \"spreading out\" or \"coming together\". On the other hand, curl measures the rotation or circulation of a vector field around a point, indicating the presence of a whirlpool-like effect. The assignment probably requires students to apply these concepts to solve problems, such as calculating the divergence and curl of given vector fields, interpreting their physical meaning, and using them to analyze and visualize various phenomena in physics and engineering, like fluid dynamics and electromagnetism.","relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453367","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Worksheet 11","description":null,"html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453564","date":"2025-04-07T23:59:59-06:00","course":"MATH 213","summary":null,"relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453564","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Exam #2","description":null,"html_url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453457","date":"2025-04-07T23:59:59-06:00","course":"MATH 213","summary":null,"relevant_links":[{"url":"https://elearning.mines.edu/courses/72125/assignments/453457","title":"Canvas"}],"has_description":false},{"name":"Topic 4A WebWork Homework","description":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_98020000000000001/attachments/7108468/dp_app3.css\"><p>Complete the Topic 4A WebWork Homework on WebWork (linked below).
